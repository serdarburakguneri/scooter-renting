# general info

I am starting a hobby project that simulates a scooter renting service just for fun!

I want to create myself some distributed system problems and solve them by playing with rabbitMQ.


The image below shows a high level architecture.

# starting the apps

There is a docker-compose.yml file under the scripts/docker-compose directory. I am thinking of 
having all necessary apps there to simulate the solution.

Simply, run

```
docker-compose build
```

and 
```
docker-compose up 
```

to have the services running. It will start a postgres, a keycloak and a rabbitmq instance for now. 
As I implement services, I will include them in the docker-compose.yml file.

# Keycloak

Keycloak is responsible for user journey such as signing in, signin up and creating JWTs. It's also responsible for
validating the tokens and authorising endpoints.

After "docker-compose up" you should have a keycloak running. 
* Simply, create a new realm and name it "auth-server".
* Change settings of the realm and enable user registration.
* By using the "account" client, you should be able to see login page. (This page is a perfect login page candidate for the UI)
* Create a new user. Later, we will use this user to create tokens etc.

# RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is used for managing the asyn communication between modules.

After "docker-compose up" you should have a rabbitMQ running.

* Visit the exposed port "15672" to ensure it's functioning well.

# Email

Email service is responsible for listening to some RabbitMQ channels ans send iformative emails to the customers.

# Payment

Payment service will simulate payments for rides. Pricing is also a part of this service, to keep the solution simple.

# Ride

Ride service is responsible for listing, unlocking and locking the scooters and manage the rides.
