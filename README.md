# General Info

I am starting a hobby project that simulates a scooter renting service just for fun!

I want to create myself some distributed system problems and solve them by playing with rabbitMQ.

Each app will have more information in their readme files. OpenAPI documents can also be found in the documentation folders.
With swagger editor, it should be easier to understand how REST endpoints work.

# Architecture

The image below shows a high level architecture.

# Starting the apps

There is a docker-compose.yml file under the scripts/docker-compose directory. I am thinking of 
having all necessary apps there to simulate the solution.

Simply, run

```
docker-compose build
```

and 
```
docker-compose up 
```

to have the services running. It will start a postgres, a keycloak and a rabbitmq instance for now. 
As I implement services, I will include them in the docker-compose.yml file.

# Keycloak

Keycloak is responsible for user journey such as signing in, signin up and creating JWTs. It's also responsible for
validating the tokens and authorising endpoints.

After "docker-compose up" you should have a keycloak running. 
* Simply, create a new realm and name it "auth-server".
* Change settings of the realm and enable user registration.
* By using the "account" client, you should be able to see login page. (This page is a perfect login page candidate for the UI)
* Create a new user. Later, we will use this user to create tokens etc.

# RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is used for managing the async communication between modules.

After "docker-compose up" you should have a rabbitMQ running.

* Visit the exposed port "15672" to ensure it's functioning well.

# Kernel

This is the main service responsible for registering, listing, unlocking and locking the scooters and managing the rental history. 

# IotClient

IOT client represents the application to run in Scooters. I am thinking of having the communication with RabbitMQ 
so scooters should simply subscribe to the queue for commands and for sending their updates. 

# Email

Email service is responsible for listening to some RabbitMQ channels and sending informative emails to the customers.

# Payment

Payment service will simulate payments for rides. Pricing is also a part of this service, to keep the solution simple.

# Use cases

These are the things I am thinking of implementing:

* An admin can register a new scooter to the system.
* An admin can modify the scooter registered.
* A user can list all scooters. Each scooter has location information, so it would be nice to filter
scooters within a geographic area.
* A user should have card information to be able to unlock a scooter.
* A user can rent and unlock a scooter.
* A user can stop the ride and lock the scooter.
* Whenever a ride ends, the payment service handles the transaction.
* Whenever a ride starts and ends, IOT server tells the scooter to be available or not.
* Each scooter send info like battery level, location and current speed etc to the IOT server.
